## Installing the Extension

The Quetzal Extension is available from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QuetzalLabs.com-getquetzal-i18nsetup).

It can be searched from the extensions panel within VSCode and Cursor.

## Using the Extension

The Quetzal extension is designed to automatically write `t` functions in your JavaScript codebase.

It adds four commands to your VSCode/Cursor Command Palette (`Command` + `Shift` + `P` to open):

1. `Quetzal: Scan for User-Facing Strings`
2. `Quetzal: Scan Current Document`
3. `Quetzal: Wrap Strings`
4. `Quetzal: Stop Scanning`

## Example: Simple Next.js Component

Suppose you have the following file open in VSCode/Cursor:

```javascript login.tsx
const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form>
        <input type="email" placeholder="Email" />
        <input type="password" placeholder="Password" />
        <button type="submit">Log In</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LoginPage;
```

We want to update this login page so that the text ("Login", "Log In", "Email", and "Password") are all translated to whichever locales your project supports.

### Run a Scan

First run `Quetzal: Scan Current Document` (`Command` + `Shift` + `P` to open the command palette)

Your editor should then look something like this:

![Extension Highlighting](/images/extension1.png)

The text highlighted in green looks like text that should be translated.

The text highlighted in red looks like text that should not be translated.

Make sure that we did not make any mistakes! If something is red but should be translated, hover over it and click `Translate this string`

Conversely, if something is green but should not be translated it, hover over it and click `Do not translate this string`

### Wrap Strings

Then, once everything looks correct, click `Quetzal: Wrap Strings` in the top right of your code editor.

Your file should now look like this:

```javascript login.tsx
import { useI18n } from "@quetzallabs/i18n";

const LoginPage = () => {
  const { t } = useI18n();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t("Login")}</h1>
      <form>
        <input type="email" placeholder={t("Email")} />
        <input type="password" placeholder={t("Password")} />
        <button type="submit">{t("Log In")}</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
export default LoginPage;
```

Notice that all text visible to your users has been wrapped in a `t` function, and the proper `t` function was imported for this client-side component.

### And you're done!

This file is now marked, and Quetzal will find and translate the text shown.

## What if I have a lot of files?

If you have a lot of files which have not been integrated with Quetzal, run `Quetzal: Scan for User-Facing Strings` (`Command` + `Shift` + `P` to open the command palette)

This will open a menu to scan several folders of your project at once, and sort all files by the number of strings that likely need to be translated.

This should allow you to rapidly integrate, even in a large codebase.
