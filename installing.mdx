## Installing Quetzal

Quetzal should be installed into the node application with text you would like to be localized.

Install the `@quetzallabs` package to match your stack:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js">``` npm install --save @quetzallabs/i18n ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="React">
    ``` npm install --save @quetzallabs/i18n-react-native ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other">
    [Contact us](https://getquetzal.com/contact) if you would like to integrate
    Quetzal with a different stack
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setting Up

After installing the package, some additional setup is required.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Setup Script">
    Run `npx quetzal-setup` in the directory you installed the Quetzal package
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set API Key">
    Set the environment variable `QUETZAL_API_KEY` to your Quetzal API Key. Your
    API Key can be found on your [project
    dashboard](https://getquetzal.com/dashboard/settings/project/0)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update quetzal.config.json">
    The setup script should have created this for you. Update `paths` so that it
    points to the directories with the code you plan to localize
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up next-intl or use-intl">
    Quetzal uses the `next-intl` package to inject translations in your app.
    Your app needs to use the `NextIntlClientProvider` from `next-intl` or the
    `IntlProvider` from `use-intl`. You will also need to update your next
    config to use the `NextIntlPlugin`. For Next.js, follow the instructions in
    the [next-intl
    docs](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started). For React,
    follow the instructions in the [use-intl
    docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-intl).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## And you're done!

Setup should be complete, and you can [start translating your app](/extension).

## Verify Your Installation

Run `npx quetzal-process-translations` to test out your installation.

If your output looks similar to the one above, then Quetzal has been installed properly and your app will begin to support other languages!

If there are errors, hopefully the error is clear and can be remedied. If not, [contact us](https://getquetzal.com/contact) and we can get your installation working.

<Tip>
  Note: This script will fail if you have not marked any text in your app for
  translation. So, you may have to [start translating your app](/extension)
  first
</Tip>

Quetzal is designed to integrate seamlessly into your build process. So, this script should be run whenever a build is made at a minimum, but it could run as often as you like.

The setup script should have added `npx quetzal-process-translations` to the pre-build script in your project's package.json, but this can be modified.
