## Welcome to Quetzal!

This documentation will walk you through how to set up and use Quetzal for Next.js and React applications

<Tip>
  Not using React/Next.js? [Contact Us](https://getquetzal.com/contact) and we
  can help get Quetzal working for your stack
</Tip>

Getting your product translated generally takes four steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Quetzal Project">
    [Sign up](https://getquetzal.com/signup) for Quetzal and you will be
    prompted to create a project. This will grant you access to the [Project
    Dashboard](/project-dashboard)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Quetzal">
    `npm install @quetzallabs/i18n` for Next.js or `npm install
    @quetzallabs/i18n-react-native` for React
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Install the VSCode/Cursor Extension">
    Install the [Quetzal VSCode/Cursor
    Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QuetzalLabs.com-getquetzal-i18nsetup)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the 't' function">
    Wrap text within your application with Quetzal's `t` function (`t("Text to
    be translated")` instead of just `"Text to be translated"`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## `next-intl` and `use-intl`

Quetzal is built on top of `next-intl` and `use-intl` to extract and serve translated text.

Refer to the [next-intl docs](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) and [use-intl docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-intl) for some setup instructions, as well as a thorough documentation of the 't' function
