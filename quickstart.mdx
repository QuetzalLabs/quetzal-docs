Next, you'll be instructed to create your first project. Give it a name, a description, and select what locales you want to translate into.

Note: We only support English as the source locale for now.

Once your project is created, run our setup script to set up your Node.js project with Quetzal.

This script does the following:

1. Installs the necessary dependencies:
    - next-intl
    - axios
    - dotenv
    - i18next-parser
2. Adds your API Key and Project ID to your `.env` file
3. Adds our translation fetcher (`fetch-translations.js`) and translations parser (`processI18n.js`) in the root directory and adds these to your `package.json` as `prebuild` scripts
4. Adds our locale detector (`i18n.ts`) which detect's the user's locale for use with `next-intl`
5. Adds our configuration for `i18next-parser` which is what gets your strings out of your application in preparation for them to be sent to us
6. Optionally installs our VSCode Extension which scans for strings and helps you quickly select which strings in your application to translate

Now it's time to configure `next-intl` for your project. `next-intl` is a tool that simply takes your strings that you introduce after using our VSCode Extension and switches them to the appropriate language after we detect what locale the user is in.

Please follow the `next-intl` setup guide [here](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started).
