## Create a Quetzal Project

First, sign up for Quetzal [here](https://getquetzal.com/signup).

You will then be prompted to create a New Quetzal Project.

<Note>Quetzal is currently free to use for one language</Note>

## Install Quetzal

Once your project is created, install our npm package to set up your Node.js project with Quetzal.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Next.js">``` npm install --save @quetzallabs/i18n ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="React">
    ``` npm install --save @quetzallabs/i18n-react-native ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Don't see an option that works for you? [Contact
  Us](https://getquetzal.com/contact) if you are unsure of how to set up Quetzal
  with your stack
</Note>

After installing, run the setup script:

```
npx quetzal-setup
```

This script will do the following:

1. Makes a change to your `.env` file so you can add your Quetzal API Key
2. Adds a template `quetzal.config.json` file for you to edit
3. Adds our locale detector (`i18n.ts`) in your project root which detect's the user's locale for use with `next-intl`
4. Adds a "prebuild" script to your `package.json` so that we can get all your strings before a build and either get the existing translations or translate new strings.

## Next-Intl Setup

Quetzal is built on [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) for Next.js apps and [use-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-intl) for React apps.

As such, you must update your app to use the `NextIntlClientProvider` or `IntlProvider`.

For Next projects, you also must include the `createNextIntlPlugin` in your next config file. This process is [documented by next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started).

## Optional: Install VSCode/Cursor Extension

To dramatically speed up integration throughout your app, install the [Quetzal VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=QuetzalLabs.com-getquetzal-i18nsetup)

## Continue setting up your project

As mentioned above, you should do the following before continuing:

1. Update your `.env` file with your `QUETZAL_API_KEY` found in the dashboard from the previous step. (If you used the setup script, this will already be added for you!)
2. Modify the `quetzal.config.json` specifying which folders to scrape for `t`-wrapped strings.
3. Update `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs` to add the `next-intl` plugin to your project:

`next.config.js`

```
const createNextIntlPlugin = require('next-intl/plugin');

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

module.exports = withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

`next.config.mjs`

```
import createNextIntlPlugin from 'next-intl/plugin';

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

export default withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

4. Add the `next-intl` provider to your `layout.tsx`, like so:

```
import {NextIntlClientProvider} from 'next-intl';
import {getLocale, getMessages} from 'next-intl/server';

export default async function RootLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const locale = await getLocale();

  // Providing all messages to the client
  // side is the easiest way to get started
  const messages = await getMessages();

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
          {children}
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Usage

Now you can use the `t` function from either the hook or the awaitable function like so:

Async/Server Components

```
import { getI18nUtils } from "@quetzallabs/i18n";

export default async function Home() {
    const { t } = await getI18nUtils();
    return <p>{t("The text of my string here")}</p>;
}
```

Client Components

```
import { useI18n } from "@quetzallabs/useI18n";

export default function Home() {
    const { t } = useI18n();
    return <p>{t("The text of my string here")}</p>;
}
```

See more information about how to use the `t` function [here](development.mdx).

## Wrapping Strings for Translation

To find the strings to translate, you can use our VSCode Extension to find all of your user-facing strings. This extension was installed as a part of the setup script. To use it:

1. Open VSCode
2. Press Cmd+Shift+P
3. Type "Quetzal" and find "Quetzal: Scan for user-facing strings"
4. Select filetypes and folders to scan for strings
5. Now you can see every file that has user-facing strings and easily wrap them appropriately

You can also use this VSCode extension on a specific file.

## Running translations

To manually submit strings for translation, run `npm run prebuild`. This will scrape all of the strings you wrapped in the previous step and send them to us for translation. This will also run when you run `npm run build`. You can see the status of these translations on the [Quetzal dashboard](https://getquetzal.com/dashboard). For a few strings, it should only take a second. For many hundreds or thousands of strings, it may take a few minutes.

And now youâ€™re done! Strings will be grabbed and translated when production builds are made going forward.
